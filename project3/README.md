# Project 3  
## Description
Project 3 - Experiments of Real World Phenomena involves implementing and testing 3 graph algorithms: diameter algorithm, clustering-coefficient algorithm and degree-distribution algorithm to determine the properties of models of real-world networks. The network model is generated based on the algorithm of Erdos-Renyi or Barabasi-Alber. Details of each algorithm can be found in the implementation and explanation can be found in the report.
